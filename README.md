# Basis Portfolio Selection and Analysis

## Introduction
### Inspiration
I was first inspired to begin this project when I first heard about the compant Titanvest(YC S18). The premise of their initial product was to analyze the 13F reports hedge funds managing over $100,000,000 in capital must report that contain their holdings. By doing this, they can in theory create a portfolio of high performing stocks with a minimal amount of research. Not needing to do as much research allows them to have less staff and therefore charge less overall. Typically hedge funds have charged a 2% management fee along with a 20% performance fee and Titanvest is able to charge only a 1% performance fee. Since first launching, they have consistantly out performed the S&P 500 by a significant amount. *separate paragraph*
